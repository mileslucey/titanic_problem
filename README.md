# Titanic Problem
## Summary
* Analysis is an entry for the [Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)
* Project uses data on Titanic passengers to create a model that predicts whether or not passengers survive the shipwreck 
* Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest are all used to model survivorship
* All three models are compared using five fold cross validation measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score
* The best performing model is the random forest model, which is used to create predict survivorship for the 418 observations in the test dataset
* See detailed analysis [here](https://github.com/mileslucey/titanic_problem/blob/master/titanic_analysis.ipynb)
* For any feedback or questions, please comment on [my Kaggle notebook analysis] (https://www.kaggle.com/mileslucey/titanic-problem)
